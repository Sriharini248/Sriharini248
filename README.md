# Hello, I'm Sriharini ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile! Iâ€™m currently pursuing my Bachelorâ€™s degree in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science at SRM Valliammai Engineering College. As an enthusiastic learner with a passion for cutting-edge technology, I am deeply interested in the fields of AI and Data Science.

## About Me 

I have a strong curiosity for exploring new technologies and am dedicated to advancing my skills in Machine Learning and Data Analytics. My academic journey and personal projects reflect my commitment to understanding and innovating within these dynamic fields.

## Current Focus

- **Machine Learning (ML)**: Enhancing my knowledge and practical skills to build intelligent systems.
- **Data Analytics**: Leveraging data to uncover insights and drive decision-making.

## Projects

Here are some of the projects Iâ€™ve been working on:

- **Gesticulation Mapping using ML**: Developed a system to control PowerPoint slides using hand gestures. Utilized LBPH (Local Binary Patterns Histograms) and OpenCV for gesture recognition.
- **Audio Enhancement and Noise Suppression System**: Created a system to improve audio quality and reduce background noise. Used Python libraries such as Torch, Pydub, and NumPy for audio processing.
- **AI Code Explainer**: Built an AI-powered tool that provides explanations and insights into code snippets. Implemented using the Palm API key and Python.
